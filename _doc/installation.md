In order to use EpiInf and visualize its analysis results the following
software must be installed:

-   BEAST 2 version 2.5 or later. <http://www.beast2.org/>
-   Tracer version 1.7 or later. <https://github.com/beast-dev/tracer/releases/latest>
-   The R statistical environment. <https://r-project.org/>

Installation

EpiInf is easily installed via the BEAUti package manager. To do this,
run BEAUti and select "Manage Packages" from the File menu:

Then, ensure the "bacter" package is highlighted before pressing the
"Install/Upgrade" button:

That's it! Bacter is now installed. It is a good idea to restart BEAUti
at this point.
